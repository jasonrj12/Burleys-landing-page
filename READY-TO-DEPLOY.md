## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. After deployment, visit:
```
https://burleys.netlify.app/
```

✅ Loaded X Google reviews
```

### 3. Scroll to reviews section
Verify:
- Real Google reviews displaying
- Verified badges visible
- Profile photos showing
- Timestamps present
- Auto-rotation working

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Function Returns 404:
1. Check `netlify.toml` is in root directory
2. Verify `netlify/functions/` directory exists
3. Redeploy: `git push origin main --force`

### If Shows Fallback Reviews:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test function endpoint directly:
   ```
   https://burleys.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/google-reviews?placeId=ChIJB9yevgdb4joRL-PLSzwW_dk&apiKey=AIzaSyC0_UIhj7Apap3O7lJX_rx-FpktVak7ig0&language=en
   ```
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### If API Not Working:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Verify "Places API" is enabled
3. Check API key has no restrictions (for testing)
4. Monitor quota usage

---

## 🔒 Important: API Key Security

### After Deployment:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click on your API key
3. Set restrictions:
   - **HTTP referrers**: `*.netlify.app/*`
   - **API restrictions**: Only "Places API"

### Why?
- Prevents unauthorized use
- Protects your API quota
- Best security practice
