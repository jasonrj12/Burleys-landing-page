## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Showing Fallback Reviews

**Check 1: Netlify Function Deployed?**
```
Visit: https://burleys.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/google-reviews?placeId=ChIJB9yevgdb4joRL-PLSzwW_dk&apiKey=AIzaSyC0_UIhj7Apap3O7lJX_rx-FpktVak7ig0&language=en
```
- Should return JSON with reviews
- If 404, function didn't deploy

**Check 2: Browser Console**
- Press F12
- Look for error messages
- Share any errors for help

**Check 3: Netlify Deploy Log**
- Go to Netlify Dashboard
- Click on your site
- Check "Deploys" tab
- Look for function installation logs

### Issue: Function Returns 404

**Solution:**
1. Check `netlify.toml` is in root directory
2. Verify `netlify/functions/` directory exists
3. Redeploy the site
4. Clear browser cache

### Issue: API Key Not Working

**Solution:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Verify Places API is enabled
3. Check API key restrictions
4. Ensure key has permissions for Places API

---

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

### 1. Restrict API Key (Important!)

In Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to Credentials → Your API Key
2. Click "Edit"
3. **Application restrictions:**
   - Select "HTTP referrers"
   - Add: `*.netlify.app/*`
   - Add: `burleys.netlify.app/*`
   - Add your custom domain if you have one

4. **API restrictions:**
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Check only "Places API"

5. Click "Save"

### 2. Monitor API Usage

1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" → "Dashboard"
3. Click on "Places API"
4. Monitor usage to ensure within free tier

---

## 💰 Cost Monitoring

### Expected Costs
With the current setup:
- **Netlify Functions**: FREE (125,000 requests/month free)
- **Google Places API**: FREE (100,000 requests/month free)
- **With 1-hour caching**: ~240 API calls/month
- **Total Cost**: $0 (well within free tiers)

### Set Up Billing Alerts
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to "Billing" → "Budgets & alerts"
3. Create alert at $5 (safety net)

## 📊 How It Works

### Request Flow:
```
User visits page
    ↓
script.js loads
    ↓
Calls: /.netlify/functions/google-reviews
    ↓
Netlify Function makes request to Google Places API
    ↓
Google returns reviews
    ↓
Function returns reviews to browser
    ↓
Reviews displayed with verified badges
    ↓
Cached in localStorage for 1 hour
```

### Why Use Netlify Functions?
- ✅ **Bypasses CORS**: Google API doesn't allow direct browser calls
- ✅ **More Secure**: API key not exposed in client code
- ✅ **Better Control**: Can add rate limiting, filtering, etc.
- ✅ **Free**: 125,000 requests/month on free tier

After deployment, your review section will show:

### Example Review Display:
